# Readme

## User story
As a boot cmap student,
I want the prework notes to be structured on a webpage,
So that I can easily find and read the information.

## Acceptance criteria
Given the prework project repository,
When I view the README for te repository,
Then I can see professional README that provides information on the project and how to use it.
